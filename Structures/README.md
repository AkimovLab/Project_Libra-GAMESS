# Here, we provide input and output (e.g. optimized or snapshots) structures discussed in this work.
#  Possibly, we provide them in various formats.
## The file name is depicted as follows:
###   1 computed system (SubPc/C60 and SubPc/nC60)
###   2 computational method such as semiempirics and DFT functional
###   3 state of the system/structure (optimized or thermalized)
###   4 what soft is used to optimize/thermalize the structure (GAMESS, Libra-X, and Gaussian)

## The input and output files corresponding to the calculation are set in "Computations" directory.
