# This directory contains a number of files for calculation.
## The file name is depicted as follows:
###   1 computed system (SubPc/C60 and SubPc/nC60)
###   2 computational method such as semiempirics and DFT functional
###   3 state of the system/structure (optimized or thermalized)
###   4 what soft is used to optimize/thermalize the structure (GAMESS, Libra-X, and Gaussian)
###   5 extension (.inp-> GAMESS input file; .out-> GAMESS output file, .gjf -> Gaussian input file, .log -> Gaussian log file )
