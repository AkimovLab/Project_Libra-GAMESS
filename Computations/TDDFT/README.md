TD-DFT calculations of the excitation energies in SubPc/(C60)_n system with different density functionals.

 Note that only CAM-B3LYP yields the first (lowest) excited state to be of the CT type [1,2] , whereas 
 both LC-omega-PBE [3,4] and omega-B97XD [5, 6] predict the first excitation to be on the SubPc unit. 

 Another set of calculations illustrates that the excitation energies are not significantly affected by the
 the envoronment: the calculations in vacuum [1,3,5] and with PCM (epsilon set to 4.2) [2,4,6] yield comparable spectra.
