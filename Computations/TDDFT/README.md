TD-DFT calculations of the excitation energies in SubPc/(C60)_n system with different density functionals.

 Note that only CAM-B3LYP yields the first (lowest) excited state to be of the CT type [1] , whereas 
 both LC-omega-PBE [2] and omega-B97XD [3, 4] predict the first excitation to be on the SubPc unit. 

 Another set of calculations illustrates that the excitation energies are not significantly affected by the
 the envoronment: the calculations in vacuum [3] and with PCM (epsilon set to 4.0) [4] yield comparable spectra.
